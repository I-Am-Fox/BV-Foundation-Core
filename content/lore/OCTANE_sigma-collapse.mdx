**Marrow:** You were in the SIGMA vault.

**Corvus:** I don’t know what that is.

**Marrow:** Vault Glass, Floor 32. The Cartography Division blacksite.

**Corvus:** That floor was already compromised when I arrived.

**Marrow:** Our records show your access at 01:48. System logged you as root authority.

**Corvus:** That’s your system’s fault. Not mine.

**Marrow:** Thirty-eight personnel dead. You were the only one left standing.

**Corvus:** I don’t know anything about that.

**Marrow:** Your suit had trace markers from SIGMA.SPLICE.

**Corvus:** Then maybe you should ask whoever put it there.

**Marrow:** You wiped your own name from the archive. Why?

**Corvus:** I didn’t. Maybe it was never there.

**Marrow:** You erased the terminal logs, torched the backups, and buried the staff IDs under encryption loops. That’s not nothing.

**Corvus:** Maybe someone really wanted this story to go missing.

**Marrow:** You're playing games.

**Corvus:** You dragged me in here. You’re the one guessing.

**Marrow:** You’re lying.

**Corvus:** Then prove it.

**Marrow:** You’re walking around with a SIGMA fragment buried in your skull.

**Corvus:** If that’s true, you should keep this room locked.

**Marrow:** What did you bring out of that vault?

**Corvus:** Dust. Maybe a few good metaphors.

**Marrow:** You expect me to believe this?

**Corvus:** I don’t expect anything. You’re the one that needs answers.

**Marrow:** We’ll run scans.

**Corvus:** You won’t find what you’re looking for.

**Marrow:** Try me.

**Corvus:** You think I’m hiding something. I think you’re looking for a scapegoat. So ask yourself - if I really know what SIGMA is, why am I still here?

**Marrow:** That’s what we’re trying to figure out.
