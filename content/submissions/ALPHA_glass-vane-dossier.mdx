### ASSET OVERVIEW

**Codename:** GLASS VANE  
**Designation:** Alpha-Class Anomaly  
**Status:** Contained – Null Observation Cell D-09  
**Handler Assigned:** None

Glass Vane is a sentient entity of unknown biology or origin. Its shape suggests a humanoid profile obscured beneath overlapping layers of opaque material resembling feathers, chitin, or brittle cloth. It is not known whether the form is protective, ceremonial, or entirely illusory. The entity does not consume, does not move unless observed doing so, and has never repeated the same path twice.

It speaks with authority. Its voice has no clear source but resonates clearly within monitored spaces. When addressed, it often replies with questions or statements disconnected from context. On several occasions, it has responded to thoughts not spoken aloud.

### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

Glass Vane stands between 2.3 and 2.5 meters tall. Height varies slightly between viewings with no observed transition. Its most visible feature is the elongated head or mask—smooth, curved, and semi-reflective—extending like a blade from where the face would be.

The surface of this 'beak' shifts in tone depending on the observer's emotional state. Some reports indicate vague movement within its hollowed sockets, though recordings show only shadow.

When light strikes its frame, it refracts in impossible angles. Certain reflective surfaces have permanently warped after extended exposure.

### CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL

- Null Observation Cell D-09 is equipped with **non-reflective surfaces** and **depth-controlled lighting**.
- One-way visual monitoring is restricted to **20-second intervals**.
- Communication attempts must be logged and authorized in writing.
- Mirrors, lenses, and water are **prohibited** within 30 meters of its cell.

Glass Vane cannot be touched. Attempts to make physical contact result in the individual experiencing **temporal dislocation**, **speech fragmentation**, and **persistent memory hallucinations**.

### BEHAVIORAL NOTES

Glass Vane does not initiate contact. It does not approach the glass. However, when spoken to, it replies—always calmly, always as though it was expecting the conversation. Some messages suggest it remembers people who are no longer living.

Observers report recurring auditory hallucinations after exposure. These are not recorded by instruments.

### ORIGIN STATUS

Located in a sinkhole breach west of [[REDACTED]], surrounded by glassed terrain and burned-out equipment. No known survivors.

Recovered after seismic anomalies drew attention to the site. All drone footage ceased functioning within 45 seconds of descent. When personnel entered, they found Glass Vane waiting—still, reflective, already within the perimeter.
