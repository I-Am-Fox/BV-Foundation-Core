# BLACK VEIL CLASSIFICATION INDEX

> **NOTICE:** The following classification schema is mandatory reading for all personnel with access to GRAY VEIL records.

Black Veil Classifications are not merely security tiers — they are indicators of an asset’s threat potential, containment volatility, and operational ambiguity. Each class is assigned based on objective analysis of observed anomaly behavior and mission criticality. Classifications are reviewed quarterly and are subject to abrupt escalation.

## *OBJECT CLASS DEFINITIONS*
---
### **ALPHA**
**Containment Rating:** None required  
**Threat Profile:** Negligible  
**Operational Status:** Monitored passively

Alpha-class anomalies exhibit no hostile behavior and pose no discernible threat to personnel or infrastructure. These assets often provide insight into paracausal phenomena and are catalogued for observation or research. Containment protocols are limited to registry and ongoing passive data collection.

---

### **BETA**
**Containment Rating:** Standard  
**Threat Profile:** Conditional  
**Operational Status:** Supervised Deployment

Beta-class assets operate on logical or moral constraints, functioning cooperatively but not under absolute control. Trust is conditional. Interaction is permitted under Tier-2 clearance or higher. Monitoring is constant, and revocation of field access is authorized at the first sign of deviation.

---

### **DELTA**
**Containment Rating:** Reinforced  
**Threat Profile:** Moderate to High  
**Operational Status:** Restricted

Delta-class anomalies demonstrate unpredictable behavior, moderate hostility, or the capacity to distort local reality fields. They are to be contained within specialized enclosures under surveillance at all times. Interaction without High Clearance is prohibited. Deployment is rare and requires full Directorate approval.

---

### **THETA**
**Containment Rating:** Encrypted Custody  
**Threat Profile:** Contextual  
**Operational Status:** Dormant or Unknown

Theta-class files pertain to interactions, entities, or incidents that defy traditional threat analysis. These records are preserved for contextual intelligence rather than active response. Information is heavily redacted or stored in encrypted vaults. Personnel may reference Theta entries only for classified cross-links.

---

### **OCTANE**
**Containment Rating:** Experimental or Live-field  
**Threat Profile:** Escalating  
**Operational Status:** In Progress

Octane-class assets are under active containment research. These may include first-contact anomalies, evolving entities, or phenomena undergoing transformation. Entries in this class are updated dynamically and should be treated as provisional.

---

### **UNCLASSIFIED**
**Containment Rating:** N/A  
**Threat Profile:** Informational  
**Operational Status:** Open Access

Entries in this class are for orientation, policy, and internal training. They are required reading for all Black Veil personnel prior to field engagement. Unclassified entries do not pertain to specific anomalies, but rather support operational structure and standardization.

---

> **REMINDER:** Any unauthorized reclassification or tampering with threat designations will result in immediate expulsion from the GRAY VEIL network and flagging for internal review.
