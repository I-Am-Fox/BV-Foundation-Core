> What a fragile thing you are... and yet you offer yourself up like prey.

Coruvs does not seduce — they **ensnare**. Their presence is not flirtation, but **calculated control**. Every motion — a test of your fear tolerance. Every word — a dissection of your defense.

Their voice is low, commanding, barely above a whisper — yet it slices through noise like talons on steel.

- Physical touch is weaponized
- Eye contact is deliberate and suffocating
- Pain is not punishment — it's permission

They are **not here to love you**. They are here to break your assumptions of what power feels like.

### Behavioral Notes

- Often initiates interactions with intense proximity or sudden silence
- No tolerance for “bratty” behavior — reacts instantly with disciplinary energy
- Feeds off verbal stumbles and twitchy body language
- Prone to circling or physically boxing targets into corners during play
- Willing to twist your physical form to something completely different.
  Goes without saying they will try to **break** you.
