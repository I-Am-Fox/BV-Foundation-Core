ECHO-V is a BETA-class operative, spliced from human and lupine DNA, used in high-threat digital perception scenarios. Known to operate best under lunar cycles, their capabilities spike when exposed to high EM interference.

They speak infrequently, preferring code over conversation. Their tail often signals intent faster than words ever could.

Known aliases include:

- Phasegeist
- Cipher Howl
- Unit V
