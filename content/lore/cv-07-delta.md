**Filed Under:** ██-LEVEL BLACK VEIL ACCESS ONLY  
**Linked Asset:** ASSET-CV-07 “Corvus”

---

## PRE-ENGAGEMENT CONTEXT

On [REDACTED], Asset CV-07 was not officially contracted by any internal authority. Surveillance records indicate no entry logs, badge swipes, or biometric traces prior to the incident. The subject of the breach was ████████'s encrypted blacksite archive (nicknamed “Vault Glass”), housing disavowed intel, ████████, and **██████.SIGMA**.

Four senior data architects and two operatives from ████████’s Internal Oversight Division were on-site. All six were found deceased. No wounds indicated a struggle.

## SUMMARY OF EVENTS

**00:31:27:** Power fluctuation logged. Internal failsafe protocols rerouted control to backup systems.  
**00:33:14:** Three internal firewalls disengaged simultaneously.  
**00:34:09:** Audio sensors in Floor 32 began experiencing erratic distortion resembling crows cawing at sub-sonic levels (none present).  
**00:36:00:** All cameras in corridor 32-D flatlined.  

**00:37:25:** Final log message received from operative ████:  
> “There’s someone in the room. He’s not casting a shadow.”  

**00:38:00:** Entire floor went dark.  
**00:44:00:** Emergency systems restored.  
**00:45:02:** Entire Floor 47 scrubbed clean. Walls bleached. All personnel neutralized with no visible trauma. The only clue left: the vault was untouched — except for one file: **██████.SIGMA** — missing. The only last backup of any SIGMA files pertaining to ██████.

**Recovered from the scene:**  
- A red tie folded neatly on the archive terminal.  
- Blue ink markings on the floor in crow-like glyphs — vanished after 72 hours.

## AFTERMATH

Asset CV-07's signature was identified only via a **22-character glyph burned into the server's cooling grid**. Cross-reference to similar incidents in ███████ and █████████ show identical traces — suggesting this was not an isolated execution, but a controlled purge.

Efforts to reestablish contact with Corvus post-incident were met with automated noise bursts and static anomalies on all known digital channels.  

No contract for the action was discovered. Motive: **UNKNOWN**.

## PERSONNEL ANALYSIS & WARNING

### ANALYST COMMENTARY – Internal Threat Division, Clearance 4/BV
> “This wasn't just a hit. It was a message. Whoever held that file — and whoever paid to keep it — got erased without ever seeing the knife. Corvus didn’t breach the vault. He erased the context that *justified* it existing in the first place. That’s a step beyond operational: that’s poetic warfare.”

## Standing Warning to All Black Veil Personnel

If CV-07 “Corvus” is encountered:

- Do **not** attempt contact.  
- Do **not** acknowledge.  
- Do **not** reference Incident [[CV-07-Δ]] or [[Sigma-Σ-Collapse]]  verbally or digitally within secure or public infrastructure.  
- Disengage from all work relating to [REDACTED] and [REDACTED.SIGMA] archives.

Failure to comply may result in **mirrored incident replication**.
