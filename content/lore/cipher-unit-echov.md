## Physical Description

- **Height:** 5’11”  
- **Build:** Lean, designed for precision and agility  
- **Hair:** White-silver, asymmetrically cut  
- **Eyes:** Ice-gray, pupil responsive to low light  
- **Distinguishing Features:**  
  • Lupine ears with directional auditory pickup  
  • Prehensile tail (stabilizer + expression)  
  • Subdermal interface threads (wrists/spine)  
  • Light scarring on lower back (source unclear)

- **Typical Attire:**  
  • Tactical asymmetrical cloak (encrypted inner lining)  
  • Data-scrambler blade (hip)  
  • Glove on left hand with worn sensor tips  
  • Embedded e-ink surfaces sewn into inner coat

## Behavioural Monitoring

- **Disposition:** Calm, precise, withdrawn  
- **Interaction Style:** Symbolic, metaphor-driven, avoids direct answers  
- **Tactical Engagement:** Compliant under logical parameters only  
- **Social Pattern:** Nonviolent, curious, reclusive under observation  
- **Behavioral Flags:**  
  • Untraceable movement within locked systems  
  • Writes during high-cognitive processing moments  
  • Doorways and spatial exits may appear altered post-interaction

## Perception Distortion Field

**Classification:** Passive / Environmental / Cognitive-phase alteration  
**Observed Effects:**  
- Changes in subject recall of physical environment  
- Surveillance corruption during close proximity  
- Temporary loss of object permanence  
- Layout inconsistency in mapped areas  
- Hallucinated audio/log entries

**Analyst Theory:**  
Unit does not alter physical reality, but distorts perception in a hyperlocalized field. This field may stem from subconscious processing loops or implanted neural architecture.

## Noted Mannerisms & Phrases  

> "I don't break rules. I just find where they're weakest."  
> "Truth is recursive. Most people just stop halfway."  
> "Maps lie. I walk what’s there."

## Analyst Commentary – G. Solenne  
> "He doesn’t bend space. He bends the way *you* remember space. He’s not editing reality — just the part you understand. That’s worse."
