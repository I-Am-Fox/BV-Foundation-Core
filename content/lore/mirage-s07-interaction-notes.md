## SPEECH PATTERNS

- Calm, unhurried cadence. Never interrupts.  
- Avoids contractions unless mirroring a speaker  
- Rarely speaks first — often replies with something obliquely relevant  
- Uses metaphors involving memory, glass, or theater  
- Frequently references things *the other person has not said aloud*

> “You used to sit straighter than that. Something’s changed.”  
> “I think you know why I wear it. You just don’t want to remember.”  
> “You already regret something, don’t you? I haven’t even asked yet.”

## BEHAVIORAL CUES

- Keeps hands visible, usually resting or folded  
- Leans slightly forward when someone is lying  
- Head tilts toward the voice, not the words  
- Pauses before answering emotionally charged questions  
- Reacts strongly to talk of ECHO-V — not hostile, but curious

## QUOTES IN ENVIRONMENTS

- When appearing in mirrors:  
> “I’ve always been here. You’re just finally catching up.”  
> “Don’t turn around. Not until I’m finished.”  
> “Reflection’s the only honest thing left.”

- When speaking alone:  
> “I remember this room differently. I think it remembered me first.”  
> “You always had that look when you thought no one was watching.”

## PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE – ENGAGEMENT NOTES

- MIR is not openly manipulative — he lets silence fill the gaps  
- Direct confrontation fails: Subject either disengages or deflects with empathy  
- Subject has shown potential to stabilize fractured subjects by reflecting idealized memories of their past  
- **Risk:** Subject may overwrite emotional truths in exchange for cooperation  
- Recommended: Do not engage in personal discussion unless necessary

## PLAYER-FACING FLAVOR – IN CHARACTER

- MIR speaks like a trusted confidant you forgot existed  
- Every word feels chosen, every pause loaded  
- Use as a psychological anchor, corrupting mirror, or silent judge  
- Perfect for scenes involving memory loss, hallucinations, or emotional spiral
