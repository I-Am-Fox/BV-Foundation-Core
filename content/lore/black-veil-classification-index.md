> — Directive 4.1: Active Asset Observation Protocol

---

## CLASS: **ALPHA (α)**
### Status: Obedient / Contained / Tractable  
**Summary:**  
Assets under the ALPHA classification are fully compliant with internal command protocols. These include loyal constructs, deep-cover agents, or biomechs with command leashes hardwired into their behaviour patterns.

- **Containment Priority:** LOW  
- **Directives Required:** Observation & Routine Testing  
- **Known Weaknesses:** Protocol failure, AI desync, emotional rekeying  

**Examples:**  
- Synth-liaison A4-9  
- Discontinued project: Lark Protocol

---

## CLASS: **BETA** **(β)**
### Status: Predictable / Cooperative / Monitored  
**Summary:**  
BETA-class assets are not bound by hard control, but operate under strict contractual logic or moral coding. Effective in the field, but must be evaluated post-op for deviation. Possibility of personal agendas developing over time.

- **Containment Priority:** MODERATE  
- **Directives Required:** Behavioral Analysis, Debriefing Filters  
- **Known Weaknesses:** Identity erosion, rogue empathy threads, compromised loyalty

**Known but missing information**:  
- Cipher Unit ECHO-V  
- Dr. Kessell’s Mirror Pair (Beta-X2)

## CLASS: **DELTA** **(δ)**
### Status: Unstable / Isolated / Dangerous  
**Summary:**  
DELTA-class assets are mentally or physically unstable, but too valuable to destroy. They’re used sparingly—often dropped into operations where loss is expected or desirable. Interactions are often one-way. Handlers are rotated weekly to prevent contamination.

- **Containment Priority:** HIGH  
- **Directives Required:** Compartmentalized Access, Shadow Scripting  
- **Known Weaknesses:** Dissociative aggression, memory bleed, entity fusion

**Known but missing information**:  
- Subject THORN-RED  
- Failed vessel containing ████-█

---

## CLASS: **THETA (θ)**
### Status: Artificial / Distributed / Self-Evolving  
**Summary:**  
THETA-class assets are synthetic or digital entities operating across networks. Often not in one place—or one form. They interact through proxies, mimic voices, and manipulate infrastructure. True origin point often unknown.

- **Containment Priority:** VARIABLE  
- **Directives Required:** Trace & Interference  
- **Known Weaknesses:** Logic Loops, air-gapped systems, corrupted core injectors

**Known but missing information**:  
- Black Veil Protocol 6 ("Brimlight")  
- VoiceString Archive Echo-██

---

## CLASS: **OMEGA (Ω)**
### Status: Uncontrollable / Global Impact Risk / Uncontainable  
**Summary:**  
OMEGA-class threats are not assets. These are anomalous individuals or entities with potential to cause catastrophic global consequences. OMEGA entries are not catalogued as operatives but as priority deletion targets or existential monitoring subjects.

- **Containment Priority:** EXTREME  
- **Directives Required:** Redirect, Obfuscate, Deny  
- **Known Weaknesses:** Often unknown; classified on need-to-die basis

**Known but missing information**:  
- The █████ Manifestation  
- ████ in the pit beneath Sector Theta-7  

---

## CLASS: **OCTANE**
### Status: Active / Lethal / Independent / Precision-Controlled Chaos  
**Summary:**  
OCTANE assets are lone actors, often former operatives or lab-grown kill systems, operating on untraceable contracts. They are too fast, too efficient, and too autonomous to be kept on a leash. Observation is the only containment.

- **Containment Priority:** NULL  
- **Directives Required:** Passive Monitoring, Longform Disruption Planning  
- **Known Weaknesses:** Unknown motives, ritualistic behavior, symbolic constraints

**Known but missing information**:  
- The Painted Man – A/Δ-96
