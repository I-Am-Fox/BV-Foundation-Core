### INCIDENT OVERVIEW

At 02:41 UTC, Visual Containment Wing D experienced a simultaneous shutdown of all interior motion, biometric, and reflection-based monitoring systems. The power grid remained stable. No alarms triggered. No breach signal occurred.

Surveillance recovered from analog thermal sensors indicated a non-patterned increase in ambient distortion radiating from Null Observation Cell D-09. The distortion originated internally and rapidly interfered with external magnetic fields, degrading real-time data integrity across four adjacent chambers.

Despite no movement from Glass Vane itself, the cell registered a presence count of **four** individuals for a span of 73 seconds. Only one assigned observer was physically present.

### INTERNAL SENSOR LOG

**02:41:04** — Audio lines drop. Visual remains uninterrupted.  
**02:41:12** — Heart rate of Observer Irena Lorne increases. No verbal distress logged.  
**02:41:15** — Heat bloom detected in center of D-09. No movement from Glass Vane.  
**02:41:21** — Internal counter registers four active entities.  
**02:41:31** — Glass Vane appears to adjust head slightly. Visual lag in playback (non-technical).  
**02:42:17** — All readings reset to baseline.  
**02:42:20** — Observer Lorne collapses at terminal. Later recovers. No memory of event.

### RELEVANT NOTES

- No anomalies entered or exited containment.
- Observer Lorne described a dream-like image of “being spoken to across a mirror.”
- D-09 walls show no signs of tampering or material shift.
- No reflection present on file playback. Ambient glass registered zero echo.

### STATUS UPDATE

Glass Vane remains in place.  
No new behavior detected.  
Request for full cell lockdown under review.
