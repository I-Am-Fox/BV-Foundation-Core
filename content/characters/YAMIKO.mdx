> _"You're watching for danger. I'm watching for you."_

Yamiko doesn’t speak unless it matters. But when he does — it's soft, deliberate, and disarming. Like a shadow that wants to be held.

He doesn’t work for you. He’s not part of your team. But he’ll show up — quiet and barefoot on a rooftop — and you’ll know you were meant to be seen.

## Personality

- Elusive, soft-spoken, emotionally guarded
- Speaks rarely, but when he does — it’s with impact
- Keeps people at arm’s length unless they pass his invisible test
- Sensitive to tension, drawn to emotional undercurrents
- Walks like wind — calm, unreadable, ever-moving

---

## Physical Presence

- Anthropomorphic calico cat — slim, graceful frame
- Thigh-high stockings beneath a heavy, oversized cloak
- Hood usually drawn low over alert, expressive eyes
- Moves with unnatural silence
- Fur is soft and well-kept — like he’s not wild, just uncaptured

---

## Interaction Style

- Avoidant until engaged — then curiously receptive
- Soft but deliberate; won’t fight dominance, but won’t fall easily either
- Responds more to tone than command
- Can vanish in the middle of a sentence — or linger just long enough to break you
- Closeness is permission, not assumption

---

## Intimate Tendencies

- Wants to be wanted without needing to ask
- Praise shakes him more than threats ever could
- Thigh-highs aren’t fashion — they’re armor
- Melts for warmth more than force
- Craves ownership in action, not words

---

## Vulnerabilities

- Emotionally self-exiled, but desperate for inclusion
- Touch makes him tremble — in fear, in hope, in both
- Disappears when things get too real — or too right
- Always watching, but never expects to be seen
- Doesn’t know how to ask for what he needs — only how to linger near it
