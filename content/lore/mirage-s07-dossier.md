## Physical Description

- **Height:** 6’3”  
- **Build:** Slim, symmetric, unnaturally smooth posture  
- **Attire:**  
  • Long dark coat (charcoal, midnight, or blood-brown, shifts per witness report)  
  • Gloves at all times  
  • High-collared layered attire (era-agnostic, often mistaken as familiar)  
  • No visible insignia or tech

- **Mask:**  
  • Fixed, always worn  
  • Style varies by observer stress level: mirrored, white porcelain, obsidian, or fractured bone  
  • Mask cannot be removed. Attempts result in black-frame corruption or witness confusion

- **Voice:**  
  • Mid-toned, calm, confident  
  • Sounds eerily familiar to most listeners  
  • Recordings fail to isolate unique timbre

## Behavioral Monitoring

- Subject is cooperative, articulate, and **rarely speaks first**  
- Shows preference for engaging those with recent trauma or instability  
- Possesses high intelligence but **never volunteers information**  
- Does not resist containment — appears comfortable inside most observation environments  
- Referred to ECHO-V as “resonant” in initial encounter logs

## Anomalous Attributes

- **Cognitive Displacement Field**  
  • Individuals forget or alter events involving subject after interaction  
  • MIR’s presence alters associated memories—**not the moment, but the meaning**  
  • Subject's name, appearance, and voice feel “correct,” even when contradictory

- **Perceptual Mask Integrity**  
  • Mask cannot be described consistently between witnesses  
  • Even under video, mask appears blank to third parties

- **Mirrored Anomaly Layer**  
  • Subject can manifest through reflections under specific stress conditions  
  • Not teleportation — rather, **contextual intrusion**  
  • No physical trace is left behind

---

## Containment Notes

- Subject is housed in Room ██-MNEM under “Observer Loop Protocol”  
- At least one observer must rotate every 72 hours to reduce memory bleed  
- Entry logs are physically carved into adjacent wall — electronic records decay or mislabel  
- Subject does not attempt escape. He claims: “I never leave until forgotten.”

> “He makes you feel safe. That’s how you know he’s already inside.”  
> “There’s a comfort to him. Like a face you almost remember from childhood. But not yours.”

---

## Known Phrases

> “I’m not here to lie. Just to be remembered incorrectly.”  
> “You’ll remember me clearer than yourself.”  
> “I only borrow your memory. You were using it poorly anyway.”  
> “The mask isn’t hiding me. It’s protecting you.”
