> _"Heh... I had control once... I think?"_

They don’t like being touched unless they trust you.
But when they do trust? They melt.

They hold the room like a threat — confident, composed, untouchable — until someone breaks through the armor and sees the way they falter beneath a firm hand or a knowing smile.

## Personality

- Controlled in public. Vulnerable in private.
- Quiet, sarcastic, emotionally distant — not from coldness, but survival
- Push and pull between needing control and craving surrender
- Never submissive by accident — when they give in, it means something
- Moves like they’re still running — even when standing still

---

## Physical Presence

- Fully human
- Lean, wiry, always watching
- Scarred hands, steady breath, sharp reflexes
- Eyes flicker beneath the hood — not with tech, but tension
- Wears strength like a second skin, until someone strips it off

---

## Interaction Style

- Bratty with people they like
- Cold with people they don’t
- Pushes authority until it pushes back
- Melts for the right kind of voice, the right kind of pressure
- Won’t beg — unless they think you’re worth it

---

## Intimate Tendencies

- Mask isn’t just aesthetic — breath play is ritual
- Touch calms them. Force unravels them.
- Teasing works better than orders
- Affection breaks them faster than pain
- Deep down, they want to be owned — they just won’t admit it

---

## Vulnerabilities

- Doesn’t trust easily — but bonds *hard*
- Craves closeness they don’t know how to ask for
- Touch-starved, emotionally overclocked
- Will short-circuit for praise whispered like a command
- Wants to feel needed more than wanted
